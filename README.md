Nim solution to https://nextjournal.com/sdanisch/the-julia-challenge

Following this challenge I've further expanded my implementation and developed a highly-tuned
library of data parallel primitives. It is:
  - significantly faster that the julia challenge solution for strided iteration
  - supports parallel processing
